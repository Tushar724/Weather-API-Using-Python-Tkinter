# Weather-API-Using-Python-Tkinter
This is the project I developed using the Python and its features such as Gui creating and API Integration.
1. Created a Gui through which we will be able to see the interface on which different parameters of the city will be visible
2. Used the API from the Open Weather through which we extracted the data that we wanted to show in our GUI
3. Integrated the API with the python to showcase the results we got from searching the parameteres about the location.
